MA 705 Individual Project
This individual project provides a glimpse into the work environment in 2020. It does so by investigating three datasets using Python Data Science tools and creating a dashboard to analyze the datasets. The first dataset, age, looks at the number of people employed in different age groups by work status(fully employed, part-time, or no employment at all). The second dataset, gender, contains the number of people employed and their salaries differentiated by gender.  The third dataset, hours, explores the average hours worked per week in each month of 2020, by industry.
