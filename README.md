MA 705 Individual Project
This individual project provides a glimpse into the work environment in 2020. It does so by investigating two datasets using Python Data Science tools and creating a dashboard to analyze the datasets. The first dataset, age, looks at the number of people employed in different age groups by work status(fully employed, part-time, or no employment at all). The second dataset, gender, contains the number of people employed and their salaries differentiated by gender.
